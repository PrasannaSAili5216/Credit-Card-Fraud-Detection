In the context of credit card fraud detection datasets, "V" in "Advanced Features (V1-V28)" refers to anonymized features that have been
  transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

  These features are typically the result of a dimensionality reduction technique applied to the original, sensitive transaction data (e.g.,
  transaction amount, time, location, etc.). This anonymization is done to protect the privacy of cardholders and financial institutions, as
  the raw features are not directly exposed.
